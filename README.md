# pokemon-teambuilder
This project implements a Pokemon Teambuilder within which the user can create a Pokemon. Once a Pokemon is selected, the app displays information about that Pokemon and allows the user to edit their Pokemon, including moves, item, ability, effort values, and more, and output their Pokemon to the PokePaste text format for use in other programs.
